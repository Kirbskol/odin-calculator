# odin-calculator

This repo relates to the final project of the Foundations course of The Odin Project.

The task is to create a calculator. The calculator I have created can complete tasks such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. It can also turn a number from positive to negative and vice versa, and can provide the square root of a number. The user also has the option to add decimal points to the number entries which will be factored into the calculations.

This one was a real challenge. I hope you enjoy my calculator. I have thoroughly enjoyed Foundations, and i'm excited to embark on the next stage of the studies, the Javascript path!

Many thanks,

Kirbskol.
